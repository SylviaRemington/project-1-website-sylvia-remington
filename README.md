Introduction - What this project does

This lab/project is oriented to synthesize all the knowledge we've learned thus far from the first two weeks of class - e.g. utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS to create a website. The main focus of this lab is to really utilize the DOM and create many Event Listeners. The focus of this assignment is more JS oriented than CSS or HTML oriented (even though there's a part of me that wants to focus on all the fun designing stuff!)
