Introduction - What this project does

This lab/project is oriented to synthesize all the knowledge we've learned thus far from the first two weeks of class - e.g. utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS to create a website. The main focus of this lab is to really utilize the DOM and create many Event Listeners. The focus of this assignment is more JS oriented than CSS or HTML oriented (even though there's a part of me that wants to focus on all the fun designing stuff!)

Ideas I'd like to create: 
(1) Ability to click on nav bar links and have them lead to a different page. / also in this section, have it in mobile apps appear on the side when the user clicks an icon.

(2) Create a modal pop up box/large-square-overlay when have been on the site for about 30 seconds where user can input their name and email to get updates

(2.5) Create a modal pop up box to say, "I just found out I am a Nigerian princess and have so much money. If you'd like to be entered in the drawing for my millions, click here."

(3) Create the main photo to stay where it's at and have the main & side content scroll above it. I'd really like 3 cascading photos underneath that the further you scroll, the more you see the different images / I think this is called "Scroll Spy: as the user scrolls down, content is revealed/animated."

(4) Social media links

(5) Other ideas: 
(a) hover where user hovers over something and more pertinent info appears
(b) a drop down menu for "creative pursuits" section
